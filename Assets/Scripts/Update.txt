Attempted to add a drop down menu to select mic option.

ERRORS:
	1 NullReferenceException
	3 SerializedObjectNotCreatableException

Suspected issue:
	-Trying to set the audiosource for the MicManager GameObject in Void Start(); the mic isn't selected yet and no option is available

Fix:
	-Set mic to default at game start, or keep GameObject disabled until required, or utilise different scenes for Main Menu/Mic Select + Test/Game

	-Create a micChanging method in MicManager.cs. Ensure it stops recording the current mic and then switches to the new mic and starts recording the new mic.

Other Todo:
	-Update the UIManager script to be more readable
	-Update the UIManager script + DropDown GameObject, so that the index of the option is returned when the SetMicOption() method is called, ensuring the correct string is called into
		the MicInput.instance.MicChange(string) method.
